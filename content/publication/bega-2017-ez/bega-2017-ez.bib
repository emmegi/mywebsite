 abstract = {Abstract There is a wide consensus by the research community and
the industry that it will not be possible to satisfy future
mobile traffic demand and application requirements by simply
evolving the current fourth-generation architecture. Instead,
there is a need for a considerable revision of the mobile
network system: such an effort is commonly referred to as the
future fifth-generation (5G) architecture, and large-scale
initiatives all around the globe have been launched worldwide to
address this challenge. While these initiatives have not yet
defined the future 5G architecture, the research community has
already invested a very substantial effort on the definition of
new individual technologies. The fact that all new proposals are
tagged as 5G has created a lot of confusion on what 5G really
is. The aim of this article is to shed some light on the current
status of the 5G architecture definition and the trends on the
required technologies. Our key contributions are the following:
(1) we review the requirements for 5G identified by the
different worldwide initiatives, highlighting similarities and
differences, (2) we discuss current trends in technologies,
showing that there is a wide consensus on the key enablers for
5G, and (3) we make an effort to understand the new concepts
that need to be devised, building on the enablers, to satisfy
the desired requirements.},
