 abstract = {The existing mechanisms to monitor vehicular traffic, such as
the use of induction loops and cameras, are expensive to deploy
and maintain. Vehicular communications opens up a new world of
optimization opportunities as each vehicle can be used as a
sensor to measure the fundamental variables defining the traffic
state (flow, density, and speed). In this article, we propose
ABEONA, a beacon-based traffic congestion algorithm and also the
name of the Roman goddess of journey, which captures the current
and recent-past traffic trends to forecast the near-future road
conditions. Compared to the existing monitoring approaches,
ABEONA allows for the estimation of the vehicular density and
reduces installation and maintenance costs. ABEONA's algorithm
incurs low overhead and enables drivers to use forecast traffic
congestion events to replan their route accordingly.},
