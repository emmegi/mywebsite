 abstract = {5G networks will grant spectacular improvements of the most
relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) while allowing
resource multi-tenancy through network slicing. However, the
other side of the coin is represented by the huge increase of
the management complexity and the need for efficient
algorithms for resource orchestration. Therefore, the
management and orchestration of the network through Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms is
considered a promising solution, as it allows to reduce the
human interaction (usually expensive and error-prone) and
scale to large scenario composed by thousands of slices in
heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we provide a review
of the current standardization efforts in this field, mostly
due to the work performed by the Experiential Network
Intelligence (ENI) industry specification group (ISG) within
the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).
Then, we thoroughly describe an exemplary use case on elastic
network management and orchestration through learning
solutions proposed by the 5GPPP project 5G-MoNArch and
recently approved at ETSI ENI.},
