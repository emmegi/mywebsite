 abstract = {By providing especially tailored instances of a virtual
network,network slicing allows for a strong specialization
of the offered services on the same shared infrastructure.
Network slicing has profound implications on resource
management, as it entails an inherent trade-off between:
(i) the need for fully dedicated resources to support
service customization, and (ii) the dynamic resource
sharing among services to increase resource efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of the system. In this paper, we
provide a first investigation of this trade-off via an
empirical study of resource management efficiency in
network slicing. Building on substantial measurement data
collected in an operational mobile network (i) we quantify
the efficiency gap introduced by non-reconfigurable
allocation strategies of different kinds of resources,
from radio access to the core of the network, and (ii) we
quantify the advantages of their dynamic orchestration at
different timescales. Our results provide insights on the
achievable efficiency of network slicing architectures,
their dimensioning, and their interplay with resource
management algorithms.},
