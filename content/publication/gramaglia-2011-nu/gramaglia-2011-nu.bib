 abstract = {Building vehicular networks in roads and highways is a
challenging research topic with a large number of applications
ranging from traffic jams and car collisions prevention to
efficient route planning. The analysis of the distance between
vehicles in roads is a key factor in, e.g., designing
vehicular networks protocols or planning a supporting
infrastructure to improve vehicular connectivity. This work
proposes a Gaussian-exponential mixture model to characterize
the time distance between vehicles in a highway lane, based on
measurements collected at different locations in several
highways of the city of Madrid, in Spain. The model arises
from the observed behavior that some vehicles travel very
close together, like in a burst mode, showing Gaussian
inter-arrival times, while other vehicles are somehow
isolated, showing exponentially distributed inter-arrival
times. The experiments show that such a Gaussian-exponential
mixture model accurately characterizes inter-vehicle times
observed from real traces.},
