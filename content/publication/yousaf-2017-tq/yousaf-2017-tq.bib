 abstract = {Network slicing is an emerging area of research, featuring a
logical arrangement of resources to operate as individual
networks, thus allowing for massively customizable service and
tenant requirements. The focus of this paper is to present the
design of a flexible 5G architecture for network slicing,
building on SDN and NFV technologies as enablers. More
specifically, we place the emphasis on techniques that provide
efficient utilization of substrate resources for network
slicing, ultimately optimizing network performance. The key
areas of consideration in our architecture revolve around
flexible service-tailored mobility, service-aware QoS/QoE
control as well as network-wide orchestration.},
