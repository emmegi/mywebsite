 abstract = {The proper modeling of road traffic is paramount to the
dependability of studies on vehicular networking solutions
intended for highway environments. Yet, it is not clear which
is the actual level of detail in the mobility representation
that is sufficient and necessary to such studies. This
uncertainty results into a variety of approaches being adopted
in the literature, and ultimately undermines the reliability
and reproducibility of research outcomes. We explore the space
of possible mobility models and performance metrics, and
pinpoint the level of detail needed for different types of
vehicular networking studies.},
