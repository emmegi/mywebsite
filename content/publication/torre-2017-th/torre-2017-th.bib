 abstract = {Reliable and reproducible research in vehicular networking
demands, among other requisites, a suitable representation of
road traffic. We leverage real-world fine-grained measurement
data recorded on the M40 highway in Madrid, Spain, to feed a
realistic and properly parameterized microscopic simulation of
vehicular mobility. The output is the first dataset of
bidirectional highway traffic that is publicly accessible to
the vehicular networking community. We leverage the dataset to
demonstrate the validity in a complete highway scenario of the
three-phase law of vehicular network connectivity, previously
proven only on single carriageways.},
