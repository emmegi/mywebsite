abstract: "Simulation is the standard approach to the performance evaluation of vehicular network solutions. However, the relevance of its results is often questioned by the adoption of unrealistic vehicular mobility representations. In this letter, we propose a measurement-based hidden Markov model that generates realistic synthetic interarrivals. The proposed methodology accurately captures important traffic dynamics and provides a reliable input for the simulation of highway vehicular networks."
