 abstract = {Simulation is the standard approach to the performance
evaluation of vehicular network solutions. However, the
relevance of its results is often questioned by the adoption of
unrealistic vehicular mobility representations. In this letter,
we propose a measurement-based hidden Markov model that
generates realistic synthetic interarrivals. The proposed
methodology accurately captures important traffic dynamics and
provides a reliable input for the simulation of highway
vehicular networks.},
