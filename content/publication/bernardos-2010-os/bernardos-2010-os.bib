 abstract = {IP mobility support has been a hot topic over the last years,
recently fostered by the role of IP in the evolution of the 3G
mobile communication networks. Standardization bodies, namely
IETF, IEEE and 3GPP are working on different aspects of the
mobility aiming at improving the mobility experience perceived
by users. Traditional IP mobility support mechanisms, Mobile
IPv4 or Mobile IPv6, are based on the operation of the terminal
to keep ongoing sessions despite the movement. The current trend
is towards network-based solutions where mobility support is
based on network operation. Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a promising
speciﬁcation that allows network operators to provide localized
mobility support without relying on mobility functionality or
conﬁguration present in the mobile nodes, which greatly eases
the deployment of the solution. This paper presents Proxy Mobile
IPv6 and the different extensions that are been considered by
the standardization bodies to enhance the basic protocol with
interesting features needed to offer a richer mobility
experience, namely, ﬂow mobility, multicast and network mobility
support.},
