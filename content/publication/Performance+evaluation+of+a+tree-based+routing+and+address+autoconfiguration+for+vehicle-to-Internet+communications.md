abstract = "Vehicular ad hoc networks have proven to be quite useful for broadcast alike communications between nearby cars, but can also be used to provide Internet connectivity from vehicles. In order to do so, vehicle-to-Internet routing and IP address autoconfiguration are two critical pieces. TREBOL is a tree-based and configurable protocol which benefits from the inherent tree-shaped nature of vehicle to Internet traffic to reduce the signaling overhead while dealing efficiently with the vehicular dynamics. This paper experimentally evaluates the performance of TREBOL using a Linux implementation under lab-controlled realistic scenarios, including real vehicular traces obtained in the region of Madrid."
