 abstract = {Network slicing represents a new paradigm to operate mobile
networks. With network slicing, the underlying infrastructure is
``sliced'' into logically separate networks that can be
customized to the specific needs of their tenant. Hands-on
experiments on this technology are essential to understand its
benefits and limits, and to validate the design and deployment
choices. While some network slicing prototypes have been built
for RANs, leveraging on the wide availability of radio hardware
and open source software, there is currently no open source
suite for end-to-end network slicing available to the research
community. In this article we fill this gap by developing an
end-to-end network slicing protocol stack, POSENS, which relies
on a slice-aware shared RAN solution. We design the required
algorithms and protocols, and provide a full implementation
leveraging on state-of-the-art software components. We validate
the effectiveness of POSENS in achieving tenant isolation and
network slices customization, showing that no price in
performance is paid toward this end. We believe that our tool
will prove very useful to researchers and practitioners working
on this novel architectural paradigm.},
