 abstract = {It is now commonly agreed that future 5G Networks will build
upon the network slicing concept. The ability to provide
virtual, logically independent ``slices'' of the network will
also have an impact on the models that will sustain the business
ecosystem. Network slicing will open the door to new players:
the infrastructure provider, which is the owner of the
infrastructure, and the tenants, which may acquire a network
slice from the infrastructure provider to deliver a specific
service to their customers. In this new context, how to
correctly handle resource allocation among tenants and how to
maximise the monetization of the infrastructure become
fundamental problems that need to be solved. In this paper, we
address this issue by designing a network slice admission
control algorithm that (i) autonomously learns the best
acceptance policy while (ii) it ensures that the service
guarantees provided to tenants are always satisfied. The
contributions of this paper include: (i) an analytical model for
the admissibility region of a network slicing-capable 5G
Network, (ii) the analysis of the system (modeled as a
Semi-Markov Decision Process) and the optimisation of the
infrastructure providers revenue, and (iii) the design of a
machine learning algorithm that can be deployed in practical
settings and achieves close to optimal performance.},
