 abstract = {There is a growing need for vehicular mobility datasets that
can be employed in the simulative evaluation of protocols and
architectures designed for upcoming vehicular networks. Such
datasets should be realistic, publicly available, and
heterogeneous, i.e., they should capture varied traffic
conditions. In this paper, we contribute to the ongoing effort
to define such mobility scenarios by introducing a novel set
of traces for vehicular network simulation. Our traces are
derived from high-resolution real-world traffic counts, and
describe the road traffic on two highways around Madrid,
Spain, at several hours of different working days. We provide
a thorough discussion of the real-world data underlying our
study, and of the synthetic trace generation process. Finally,
we assess the potential impact of our dataset on networking
studies, by characterizing the connectivity of vehicular
networks built on the different traces. Our results underscore
the dramatic impact that relatively small communication range
variations have on the network. Also, they unveil previously
unknown temporal dynamics of the topology of highway vehicular
networks, and identify their causes.},
