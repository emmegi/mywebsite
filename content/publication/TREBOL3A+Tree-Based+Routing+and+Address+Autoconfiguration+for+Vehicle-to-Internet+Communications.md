abstract = "Efficient vehicle-to-internet routing and address autoconfiguration are two of the missing pieces required to provide Internet connectivity from vehicles. Here, we propose TREBOL, a tree-based and configurable protocol which benefits from the inherent tree-shaped nature of vehicle to Internet traffic to reduce the signaling overhead while dealing efficiently with the vehicular dynamics. The paper describes the design and rationale of the solution, and presents the results of an experimental validation and performance evaluation, based on extensive simulations and real vehicular traces obtained in the region of Madrid."
