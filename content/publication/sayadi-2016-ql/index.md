abstract: "To build a flexible and an adaptable architecture network supporting variety of services and their respective requirements, 5G NORMA introduced a network of functions based architecture breaking the major design principles followed in the current network of entities based architecture. This revolution exploits the advantages of the new technologies like Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in conjunction with the network slicing and multi-tenancy concepts. In this paper we focus on the concept of Software Defined for Mobile Network Control (SDM-C) network: its definition, its role in controlling the intra network slices resources, its specificity to be QoE aware thanks to the QoE/QoS monitoring and modeling component and its complementarity with the orchestration component called SDM-O. To operate multiple network slices on the same infrastructure efficiently through controlling resources and network functions sharing among instantiated network slices, a common entity named SDM-X is introduced. The proposed design brings a set of new capabilities to make the network energy efficient, a feature that is discussed through some use cases."
