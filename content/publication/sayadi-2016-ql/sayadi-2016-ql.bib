 abstract = {To build a flexible and an adaptable architecture network
supporting variety of services and their respective
requirements, 5G NORMA introduced a network of functions based
architecture breaking the major design principles followed in
the current network of entities based architecture. This
revolution exploits the advantages of the new technologies like
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) in conjunction with the network slicing and
multi-tenancy concepts. In this paper we focus on the concept of
Software Defined for Mobile Network Control (SDM-C) network: its
definition, its role in controlling the intra network slices
resources, its specificity to be QoE aware thanks to the QoE/QoS
monitoring and modeling component and its complementarity with
the orchestration component called SDM-O. To operate multiple
network slices on the same infrastructure efficiently through
controlling resources and network functions sharing among
instantiated network slices, a common entity named SDM-X is
introduced. The proposed design brings a set of new capabilities
to make the network energy efficient, a feature that is
discussed through some use cases.},
