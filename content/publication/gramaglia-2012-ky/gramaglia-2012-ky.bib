 abstract = {In this article we make a thorough characterization and
evaluation of the solution standardized by the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute for IPv6 transmission of
packets over geographical location aware vehicular networks. In
particular, we focus on IPv6 address auto-configuration, one of
the required pieces to enable Internet connectivity from
vehicles. Communications in vehicular networks are strongly
dependent on the availability of multi-hop connectivity to the
fixed infrastructure, so also we analyze the probability of
achieving this connectivity under different circumstances, and
we use the results to identify interesting target scenarios for
address auto-configuration mechanisms. Keeping those scenarios
in mind, we perform a characterization and deep
evaluation--analytically and by means of simulations--of the
standardized IPv6 address au-toconfiguration solution, proposing
some configuration guidelines and highlighting the scenarios
where complementary enhancements might be needed.},
