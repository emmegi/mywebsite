 abstract = {Most of the cellular network operators are nowadays striving to
solve the problem caused by the increasing demand of mobile data
users. In the near future, vehicles will be equipped not only
with cellular connectivity, but also with dedicated short-range
wireless devices, used to connect via single or multiple hops to
fixed road side units attached to the infrastructure network to
gain Internet access. Taking this hybrid-connectivity scenario,
we propose S eamless I nternet 3G and Opportunistic WL AN V
ehicular I nternet Co nnectivity (SILVIO), a solution for
providing Internet connectivity in multi-hop vehicular ad hoc
networks. Vehicles use the cellular network to assure always-on
connectivity, while they opportunistically select to offload
some non-critical flows to the multi-hop wireless local area
network (WLAN). The advantages of this approach are twofold: the
users can benefit from a higher bandwidth, while the operators
can alleviate their overloaded cellular networks. SILVIO makes
use of existing standard mobility mechanisms integrated,
enhanced and extended to provide a seamless connectivity
experience without introducing much complexity nor signalling
overhead. One of the main contributions of this article is the
proposal and analysis of different handover strategies between
3G and multi-hop WLAN networks for the vehicular scenario. A
trace-driven simulator was developed to evaluate the performance
improvements provided by SILVIO. Real traffic traces from the
city of Madrid were used to feed the simulator which considers
large vehicles as obstacles, as well. The obtained results show
that using SILVIO the cellular network can be offloaded by a
factor up to 80%.},
