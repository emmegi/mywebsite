 abstract = {Abstract We are currently observing the softwarization of
communication networks, where network functions are translated
from monolithic pieces of equipment to programs running over a
shared pool of computational, storage, and communication
resources. While it is clear that almost any softwarization
improves flexibility (eg, the ability to instantiate more
servers to cope with increasing traffic demand), in this paper,
we advocate for a complete redesign of the communications
protocol stack, instead of a mere translation of hardware
functions into software. We discuss 2 drivers for this
cloud-aware redesign: (1) relaxing the tight interactions
between functions and (2) supporting a graceful degradation of
the service when resources become scarce. The potential benefits
of this redesign are illustrated with the numerical evaluation
of one use case.},
