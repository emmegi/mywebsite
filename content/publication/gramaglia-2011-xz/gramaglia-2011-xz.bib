 abstract = {In order to provide efficient Internet connectivity from
vehicles, three fundamental functionalities are needed: IP
address autoconfiguration, enhanced routing and mobility
support. This extended abstract provides a brief view of the
work done so far in this research work, that aims at providing
a solution for these three open issues. An analytical model
for an address autoconfiguration mechanism and a routing
protocol have been already proposed, with accepted
contributions. A third line analyzing mobility aspects is
currently being developed. Another accepted contribution is a
statistical framework for studying the interarrival time
between vehicles, that has been elaborated using real traffic
measurements.},
