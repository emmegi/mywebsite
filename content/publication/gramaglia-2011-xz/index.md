abstract: "In order to provide efficient Internet connectivity from vehicles, three fundamental functionalities are needed: IP address autoconfiguration, enhanced routing and mobility support. This extended abstract provides a brief view of the work done so far in this research work, that aims at providing a solution for these three open issues. An analytical model for an address autoconfiguration mechanism and a routing protocol have been already proposed, with accepted contributions. A third line analyzing mobility aspects is currently being developed. Another accepted contribution is a statistical framework for studying the interarrival time between vehicles, that has been elaborated using real traffic measurements."
