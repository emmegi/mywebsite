 abstract = {GeoSAC is a mechanism that enables IPv6 address autoconﬁgur ation
in vehicular networks based on geographic routing. It is built
using one of the most know networking stack in the ﬁeld of VANET,
the one proposed by the car-to-car conso rtium. GeoSAC adapts the
existing IPv6 stateless address autoconﬁguration prot ocol to
VANETs. In this thesis we analytically model GeoSAC in order to
evaluate its perfomance, especially in terms of conﬁguration
times. Then we propose an optimization for this protocol using
router advertisement caching which has also been modeled. We
validate both the model we proposed by means of simulation.
Simulation results show that our optimization signiﬁcantly
improves the performance in terms of conﬁguration time but also
for si gnalling overhead.},
