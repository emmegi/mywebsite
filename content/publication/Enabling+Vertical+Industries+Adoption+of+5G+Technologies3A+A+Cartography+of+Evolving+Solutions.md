abstract = "5G network technologies are evolving in a tremendous pace, enhancing the potential for being adopted and exploited by vertical industries and serve advance networking requirements needs. Towards this direction, a set of 5G PPP projects are providing contributions for tackling aspects related to the overall lifecycle of 5G vertical applications design, development and deployment, including the activation and management of the appropriate network services. In this paper, a cartography of a set of novel solutions facilitating the adoption of 5G technologies by vertical industries is presented, aiming at identifying set of challenges and relevant solutions as well as potential synergies among the related projects."
