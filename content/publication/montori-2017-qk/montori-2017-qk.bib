 abstract = {The integration of automotive communications in 5G systems must
build on a clear understanding of the performance of services
for connected vehicles in today's LTE deployments. In this
paper, we carry out a simulation-based performance evaluation of
automotive communications in LTE, with particular attention to
realism: to that end, we investigate the impact of different
road traffic models, employ a state-of-the-art commercial LTE
tool, and study a practical service use case. Our results
demonstrate that unrealistic road traffic datasets can bias
network simulations in urban vehicular environments, and provide
insights on the limitations of the current radio access
architecture, when confronted to connected vehicles.},
