 abstract = {Orchestrating resources in 5G and beyond-5G systems will be
substantially more complex than it used to be in previous
generations of mobile networks. In order to take full advantage
of the unprecedented possibilities for dynamic reconfiguration
offered by network softwarization and virtualization
technologies, operators have to embed intelligence in network
resource orchestrators. We advocate that the automated,
data-driven decisions taken by orchestrators must be guided by
considerations on the cost that such decisions involve for the
operator. We show that such a strategy can be implemented via a
deep learning architecture that forecasts capacity rather than
plain traffic, thanks to a novel loss function named alfa-OMC.
We investigate the convergence properties of alfa-OMC, and
provide preliminary results on the performance of the learning
process in case studies with real-world mobile network traffic.},
