abstract = "Reliable and reproducible research in vehicular networking demands, among other requisites, a suitable representation of road traffic. We leverage real-world fine-grained measurement data recorded on the M40 highway in Madrid, Spain, to feed a realistic and properly parameterized microscopic simulation of vehicular mobility. The output is the first dataset of bidirectional highway traffic that is publicly accessible to the vehicular networking community. We leverage the dataset to demonstrate the validity in a complete highway scenario of the three-phase law of vehicular network connectivity, previously proven only on single carriageways."
