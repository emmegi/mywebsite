abstract: "Summary Future intelligent transportation systems (ITS) will rely heavily on new data transmission technologies, which will transform vehicles into actual communication hubs. Among such ITS-enabling technologies, those realizing direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication are the most disruptive. This chapter focuses on the representation of road traffic for the simulation of highway vehicular networks based on V2V communication technologies. It reviews different open-access approaches to highway road traffic modeling for network simulation. The recognized impact of road traffic modeling on the simulation of vehicular networks has led to a significant effort in increasing the realism of road traffic traces used by network simulators. The generation of synthetic vehicular traces is the de facto standard approach to road traffic modeling. The chapter presents the mobility models, and considers an original fine-tuned mobility model that builds on measurement data."
