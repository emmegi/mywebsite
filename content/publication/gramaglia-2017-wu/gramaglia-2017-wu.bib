 abstract = {Summary Future intelligent transportation systems (ITS) will
rely heavily on new data transmission technologies, which will
transform vehicles into actual communication hubs. Among such
ITS-enabling technologies, those realizing direct
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication are the most disruptive.
This chapter focuses on the representation of road traffic for
the simulation of highway vehicular networks based on V2V
communication technologies. It reviews different open-access
approaches to highway road traffic modeling for network
simulation. The recognized impact of road traffic modeling on
the simulation of vehicular networks has led to a significant
effort in increasing the realism of road traffic traces used by
network simulators. The generation of synthetic vehicular traces
is the de facto standard approach to road traffic modeling. The
chapter presents the mobility models, and considers an original
fine-tuned mobility model that builds on measurement data.},
