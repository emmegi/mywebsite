 abstract = {The current lack of reference datasets of road traffic mobility
for network simulation jeopardizes the reliability and
reproducibility of vehicular networking research. We contribute
to the ongoing effort to develop dependable and publicly
available mobility traces through the following: (1)
implementing an original version of the Simulation of Urban
Mobility (SUMO) road network conversion tool that allows
importing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in a neat automated fashion,
(2) generating an original dataset of road traffic in Bologna,
Italy, and (3) providing a novel validation methodology that
builds on open data provided by navigation service, which we
leverage to assess the quality of the proposed Bologna dataset.
These three contributions are expected to benefit the whole
research community, since they not only provide a new
ready-to-use realistic dataset that can be input to network
simulators but ease the generation and validation of further
vehicular mobility traces for networking research as well.},
