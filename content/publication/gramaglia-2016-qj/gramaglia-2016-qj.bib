 abstract = {The goal envisioned by 5G NORMA is to develop a novel,
adaptive and future-proof 5G mobile network architecture. In
order to fulfill these requirements, 5G NORMA envisions an
extremely flexible architecture to be deployed in a multi-tier
distributed data-center. In this paper we focus on the novel
mobility management schemes, QoE/QoS, Control and
Orchestration mechanisms that are being developed in 5G NORMA.
These modules, that follow the software-defined principle,
jointly optimize core and access functions. The final result
is a modular architecture that adapts to the requirements of
very heterogeneous services, while allowing multiple tenants
to share network resources among them, providing hence the
flexible connectivity needed by future 5G Networks.},
