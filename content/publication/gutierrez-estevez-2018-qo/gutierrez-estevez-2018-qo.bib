 abstract = {Vertical markets and industries are addressing a large
diversity of heterogeneous services, use cases, and
applications in 5G. It is currently common understanding that
for networks to be able to satisfy those needs, a flexible,
adaptable, and programmable architecture based on network
slicing is required. Moreover, a softwarization and
cloudification of the communications networks is already
happening, where network functions (NFs) are transformed from
monolithic pieces of equipment to programs running over a
shared pool of computational and communication resources.
However, this novel architecture paradigm requires new
solutions to exploit its inherent flexibility. In this paper,
we introduce the concept of resource elasticity as a key means
to make an efficient use of the computational resources in 5G
systems. Besides establishing a definition as well as a set of
requirements and key performance indicators (KPIs), we propose
mechanisms for the exploitation of elasticity in three
different dimensions, namely computational elasticity in the
design and scaling of NFs, orchestration-driven elasticity by
flexible placement of NFs, and slice-aware elasticity via
cross-slice resource provisioning mechanisms. Finally, we
provide a succinct analysis of the architectural components
that need to be enhanced to incorporate elasticity principles.},
