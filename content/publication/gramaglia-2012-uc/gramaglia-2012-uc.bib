 abstract = {This paper presents a micro-payment-based incentive mechanism for
long-term peer-to-peer storage systems. The main novelty of the
proposed incentive mechanism is to allow users to be off-line for
extended periods of time without updating or renewing their
information by themselves. This feature is enabled through a
digital cheque, issued by the user, which is later employed by
the peers to get a gratification for storing the user's
information when the user is off-line. The proposed P2P backup
system also includes a secure and lightweight data verification
mechanism. Moreover, the proposed incentive also contributes to
improve the availability of the stored information and the
scalability of the whole system. The paper details the
verification and cheque-based incentive mechanisms in the context
of a P2P backup service and analyzes its scalability and security
properties. The system is furthermore validated by means of
simulation, proving the effectiveness of the proposed incentive.},
