 abstract = {Store-carry-and-forward is extensively used in vehicular
environments for many and varied purposes, including routing,
disseminating, downloading, uploading, or offloading
delay-tolerant content. The performance gain of
store-carry-and-forward over traditional connected forwarding
is primarily determined by the fact that it grants a much
improved network connectivity. Indeed, by letting vehicles
physically carry data, store-carry-and-forward adds a temporal
dimension to the (typically fragmented) instantaneous network
topology that is employed by connected forwarding. Temporal
connectivity has thus a important role in the operation of a
wide range of vehicular network protocols. Still, our
understanding of the dynamics of the temporal connectivity of
vehicular networks is extremely limited. In this paper, we
shed light on this underrated aspect of vehicular networking,
by exploring a vast space of scenarios through an evolving
graph-theoretical approach. Our results show that using
store-carry-and-forward greatly increases connectivity,
especially in very sparse networks. Moreover, using
store-carry-and-forward mechanisms to share content within a
geographically-bounded area can be very efficient, i.e., new
entering vehicles can be reached rapidly.},
