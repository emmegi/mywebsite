 abstract = {In this paper, we define a flexible, adaptable, and programmable
architecture for 5G mobile networks, taking into consideration
the requirements, KPIs, and the current gaps in the literature,
based on three design fundamentals: (i) split of user and
control plane, (ii) service-based architecture within the core
network (in line with recent industry and standard consensus),
and (iii) fully flexible support of E2E slicing via per-domain
and cross-domain optimisation, devising inter-slice control and
management functions, and refining the behavioural models via
experiment-driven optimisation. The proposed architecture model
further facilitates the realisation of slices providing specific
functionality, such as network resilience, security functions,
and network elasticity. The proposed architecture consists of
four different layers identified as network layer, controller
layer, management and orchestration layer, and service layer. A
key contribution of this paper is the definition of the role of
each layer, the relationship between layers, and the
identification of the required internal modules within each of
the layers. In particular, the proposed architecture extends the
reference architectures proposed in the Standards Developing
Organisations like 3GPP and ETSI, by building on these while
addressing several gaps identified within the corresponding
baseline models. We additionally present findings, the design
guidelines, and evaluation studies on a selected set of key
concepts identified to enable flexible cloudification of the
protocol stack, adaptive network slicing, and inter-slice
control and management.},
