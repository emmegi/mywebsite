 abstract = {Efficient vehicle-to-internet routing and address
autoconfiguration are two of the missing pieces required to
provide Internet connectivity from vehicles. Here, we propose
TREBOL, a tree-based and configurable protocol which benefits
from the inherent tree-shaped nature of vehicle to Internet
traffic to reduce the signaling overhead while dealing
efficiently with the vehicular dynamics. The paper describes
the design and rationale of the solution, and presents the
results of an experimental validation and performance
evaluation, based on extensive simulations and real vehicular
traces obtained in the region of Madrid.},
