 abstract = {The design, standardization and future deployment of vehicular
communications systems have been driven so far by safety
applications. There are two more aspects of the vehicular
networking that have increased their importance in the last
years: infotainment and traffic efficiency, as they can improve
drivers' experience, making vehicular communications systems more
attractive to end-users. In this thesis we propose optimization
mechanisms for both types of vehicular services. Infotainment
services are related to the provision of classic IP applications,
like browsing, reading e-mail or using social networks. Traffic
efficiency services are those accessing new capabilities to the
car-navigation systems, aiming at optimizing the usage of road
infrastructures, reducing travel times and therefore minimizing
the ecological footprint. Bringing infotainment services to the
vehicular environment requires to comply with standard protocols
and mechanisms that allow heterogeneous networks to be
interconnected in the Internet. There are three main
functionalities that have to be provided: i) address
autoconfiguration, ii) efficient routing and iii) mobility
management. Regarding infotainment services, this thesis proposes
mechanisms tackling the abovenamed aspects: an overhearing
technique to improve an already standardized address
autoconfiguration protocol, a tree-based routing algorithm
especially tailored for vehicleto-Internet communications and an
optimized mobility management approach for vehicular
environments. Regarding traffic efficiency, this thesis proposes
two algorithms that make use of vehicular communication
techniques to monitor and forecast short-term traffic conditions.
We first improved our knowledge on drivers' behavior by analyzing
real vehicular data traces, and proposes a mixture model for the
vehicles interarrival time. This outcome was used for validating
the proposed infotainment optimization as well. All the
algorithms and analytical models described in this thesis have
been validated by simulations and/or implementations using
standard hardware.},
