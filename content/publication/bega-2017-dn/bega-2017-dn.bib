 abstract = {In addition to providing substantial performance enhancements,
future 5G networks will also change the mobile network
ecosystem. Building on the network slicing concept, 5G allows
to ``slice'' the network infrastructure into separate logical
networks that may be operated independently and targeted at
specific services. This opens the market to new players: the
infrastructure provider, which is the owner of the
infrastructure, and the tenants, which may acquire a network
slice from the infrastructure provider to deliver a specific
service to their customers. In this new context, we need new
algorithms for the allocation of network resources that
consider these new players. In this paper, we address this
issue by designing an algorithm for the admission and
allocation of network slices requests that (i) maximises the
infrastructure provider's revenue and (ii) ensures that the
service guarantees provided to tenants are satisfied. Our key
contributions include: (i) an analytical model for the
admissibility region of a network slicing-capable 5G Network,
(ii) the analysis of the system (modelled as a Semi-Markov
Decision Process) and the optimisation of the infrastructure
provider's revenue, and (iii) the design of an adaptive
algorithm (based on Q-learning) that achieves close to optimal
performance.},
