 abstract = {The novel network slicing paradigm represents an effective
turning point to operate future wireless networks. Available
networking and computational resources may be shared across
different (instantiations of) services tailored onto specific
vertical needs, envisioned as the main infrastructure tenants.
While such customization enables meeting advanced key
performance indicators (KPIs) introduced by upcoming 5G
networks, advanced multi-tenancy approaches help to abate the
cost of deploying and operating the network. However, the
network slicing implementation requires a number of non-trivial
practical considerations, including how resource sharing
operations are actually implemented, how involved parties
establish the corresponding agreement to instantiate, operate,
and terminate such a sharing or the design of functional modules
and interfaces supporting these operations. In this paper, we
present a novel framework that unveils proper answers to the
above design challenges. While existing initiatives are
typically limited to single-domain and single-owner scenarios,
our framework overcomes these limitations by enlarging the
administrative scope of the network deployments fostering
different providers to collaborate so as to facilitate a larger
set of resources even spread across multiple domains. Numerical
evaluations confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the
presented solution.},
