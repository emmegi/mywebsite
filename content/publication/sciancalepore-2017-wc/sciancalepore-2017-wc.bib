 abstract = {The emerging network slicing paradigm for 5G provides new
business opportunities by enabling multi-tenancy support. At
the same time, new technical challenges are introduced, as
novel resource allocation algorithms are required to
accommodate different business models. In particular,
infrastructure providers need to implement radically new
admission control policies to decide on network slices
requests depending on their Service Level Agreements (SLA).
When implementing such admission control policies,
infrastructure providers may apply forecasting techniques in
order to adjust the allocated slice resources so as to
optimize the network utilization while meeting network slices'
SLAs. This paper focuses on the design of three key network
slicing building blocks responsible for (i) traffic analysis
and prediction per network slice, (ii) admission control
decisions for network slice requests, and (iii) adaptive
correction of the forecasted load based on measured
deviations. Our results show very substantial potential gains
in terms of system utilization as well as a trade-off between
conservative forecasting configurations versus more aggressive
ones (higher gains, SLA risk).},
