 abstract = {Network slicing is a new paradigm for future 5G networks where
the network infrastructure is divided into slices devoted to
different services and customized to their needs. With this
paradigm, it is essential to allocate to each slice the needed
resources, which requires the ability to forecast their
respective demands. To this end, we present DeepCog, a novel
data analytics tool for the cognitive management of resources
in 5G systems. DeepCog forecasts the capacity needed to
accommodate future traffic demands within individual network
slices while accounting for the operator's desired balance
between resource overprovisioning (i.e., allocating resources
exceeding the demand) and service request violations (i.e.,
allocating less resources than required). To achieve its
objective, DeepCog hinges on a deep learning architecture that
is explicitly designed for capacity forecasting. Comparative
evaluations with real-world measurement data prove that
DeepCog's tight integration of machine learning into resource
orchestration allows for substantial (50% or above) reduction
of operating expenses with respect to resource allocation
solutions based on state-of-the-art mobile traffic predictors.
Moreover, we leverage DeepCog to carry out an extensive first
analysis of the trade-off between capacity overdimensioning
and unserviced demands in adaptive, sliced networks and in
presence of real-world traffic.},
