 abstract = {Enterprise Networking has a strong set of requirements in terms
of resiliency, reliability and resources usage. With current
approaches being based on monolithic and expensive
infrastructures using dedicated overlay links, providers are
moving to more economical hybrid solutions that encompass
private dedicated links with public/regular Internet
connections. However, these usually rely on complex,
hardware-dependent and/or proprietary Traffic Engineering (TE)
solutions, which are computationally costly, in particular for
the forwarding nodes. In this paper, we propose SEMPER: a
lightweight TE solution based on MP-TCP that, in contrast to
other TE solutions, moves the complexity to the endpoints of the
connection, and relieves the forwarding elements from complex
operations or even maintaining state. As our evaluation shows,
SEMPER efficiently makes use of all available paths between the
endpoints while maintaining fairness, and properly adapts to
variations on the available capacity.},
