 abstract = {We investigate how individual mobile services are consumed
at a national scale, by studying data collected in a 3G/4G
mobile network deployed over a major European country.
Through correlation and clustering analyses, our study
unveils a strong heterogeneity in the demand for different
mobile services, both in time and space. In particular, we
show that: (i) somehow surprisingly, almost all considered
services exhibit quite different temporal usage patterns,
(ii) in contrast to such temporal behavior, spatial
patterns are fairly uniform across all services, (iii)
when looking at usage patterns at different locations, the
average traffic volume per user is dependent on the
urbanization level, yet its temporal dynamics are not. Our
findings do not only have sociological implications, but
are also relevant to the orchestration of network
resources.},
