abstract: "We investigate how individual mobile services are consumed at a national scale, by studying data collected in a 3G/4G mobile network deployed over a major European country. Through correlation and clustering analyses, our study unveils a strong heterogeneity in the demand for different mobile services, both in time and space. In particular, we show that: (i) somehow surprisingly, almost all considered services exhibit quite different temporal usage patterns, (ii) in contrast to such temporal behavior, spatial patterns are fairly uniform across all services, (iii) when looking at usage patterns at different locations, the average traffic volume per user is dependent on the urbanization level, yet its temporal dynamics are not. Our findings do not only have sociological implications, but are also relevant to the orchestration of network resources."
