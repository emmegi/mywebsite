 abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) of mobile and wireless communications
networks aims at addressing a diverse set of use cases,
services, and applications with a particular focus on enabling
new business cases via network slicing. The development of 5G
has thus advanced quickly with research projects and
standardization efforts resulting in the 5G baseline
architecture. Nevertheless, for the realization of native
end-to-end (E2E) network slicing, further features and
optimizations shall still be introduced. In this paper,
essential building blocks and design principles of the 5G
architecture will be discussed capitalizing on the innovations
that are being developed in the 5G-MoNArch project. Furthermore,
building on the concept of resource elasticity introduced by
5G-MoNArch and briefly re-summarized in this paper, an
elasticity functional architecture is presented where the
architectural implications required for each of the three
dimensions of elasticity are described, namely computational,
orchestration-driven, and slice-aware elasticity.},
