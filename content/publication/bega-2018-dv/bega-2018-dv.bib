 abstract = {In a virtualized radio access network (RAN), baseband processing
is performed by software running in cloud-computing platforms.
However, current protocol stacks were not designed to run in
this kind of environment, the high variability on the
computational resources consumed by RAN functions may lead to
eventual computational outages (where frames are not decoded on
time), severely degrading the resulting performance. In this
paper, we address this issue by re-designing two key functions
of the protocol stack: 1) scheduling, to select the transmission
of those frames that do not result in computational outages, and
2) modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection, to downgrade
the selected MCS in case no sufficient computational resources
are available. We formulate the resulting problem as a joint
optimization and compute the (asymptotically) optimal solution
to this problem. We further show that this solution involves
solving an NP-hard problem, and propose an algorithm to obtain
an approximate solution that is computationally efficient while
providing bounded performance over the optimal. We thoroughly
evaluate the proposed approach via simulation, showing that it
can provide savings as high as 80% of the computational
resources while paying a small price in performance.},
