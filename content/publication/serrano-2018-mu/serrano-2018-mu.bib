 abstract = {We are currently observing the softwarization of communication
networks, where network functions are translated from monolithic
pieces of equipment to programs running over a shared pool of
computational, storage, and communication resources. As the
amount of this resources might vary over time, in this paper we
discuss the potential benefits of introducing resource awareness
to softwarized network functions. More specifically, we focus on
the case of computational elasticity, namely, the ability to
endure shortages of computational resources while providing an
adequate (although non-ideal) service. We discuss how to enable
this ability by redesigning network functions, and illustrate
the potential benefits of this approach with a numerical
evaluation.},
