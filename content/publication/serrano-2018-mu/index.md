abstract: "We are currently observing the softwarization of communication networks, where network functions are translated from monolithic pieces of equipment to programs running over a shared pool of computational, storage, and communication resources. As the amount of this resources might vary over time, in this paper we discuss the potential benefits of introducing resource awareness to softwarized network functions. More specifically, we focus on the case of computational elasticity, namely, the ability to endure shortages of computational resources while providing an adequate (although non-ideal) service. We discuss how to enable this ability by redesigning network functions, and illustrate the potential benefits of this approach with a numerical evaluation."
