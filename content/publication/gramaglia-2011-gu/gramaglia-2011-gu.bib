 abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks have proven to be quite useful for
broadcast alike communications between nearby cars, but can
also be used to provide Internet connectivity from vehicles.
In order to do so, vehicle-to-Internet routing and IP address
autoconfiguration are two critical pieces. TREBOL is a
tree-based and configurable protocol which benefits from the
inherent tree-shaped nature of vehicle to Internet traffic to
reduce the signaling overhead while dealing efficiently with
the vehicular dynamics. This paper experimentally evaluates
the performance of TREBOL using a Linux implementation under
lab-controlled realistic scenarios, including real vehicular
traces obtained in the region of Madrid.},
