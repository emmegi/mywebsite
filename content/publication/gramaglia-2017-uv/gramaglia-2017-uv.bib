 abstract = {Mobile network operators can track subscribers via passive
or active monitoring of device locations. The recorded
trajectories offer an unprecedented outlook on the
activities of large user populations, which enables
developing new networking solutions and services, and
scaling up studies across research disciplines. Yet, the
disclosure of individual trajectories raises significant
privacy concerns: thus, these data are often protected by
restrictive non-disclosure agreements that limit their
availability and impede potential usages. In this paper, we
contribute to the development of technical solutions to the
problem of privacy-preserving publishing of spatiotemporal
trajectories of mobile subscribers. We propose an algorithm
that generalizes the data so that they satisfy
$k^\τ,ε\$-anonymity, an original privacy
criterion that thwarts attacks on trajectories. Evaluations
with real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm
attains its objective while retaining a substantial level of
accuracy in the data. Our work is a step forward in the
direction of open, privacy-preserving datasets of
spatiotemporal trajectories.},
