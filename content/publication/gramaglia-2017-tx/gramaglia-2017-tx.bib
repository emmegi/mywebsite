 abstract = {Mobile network operators can track subscribers via passive or
active monitoring of device locations. The recorded
trajectories offer an unprecedented outlook on the activities
of large user populations, which enables developing new
networking solutions and services, and scaling up studies
across research disciplines. Yet, the disclosure of individual
trajectories raises significant privacy concerns: thus, these
data are often protected by restrictive non-disclosure
agreements that limit their availability and impede potential
usages. In this paper, we contribute to the development of
technical solutions to the problem of privacy-preserving
publishing of spatiotemporal trajectories of mobile
subscribers. We propose an algorithm that generalizes the data
so that they satisfy-anonymity, an original privacy criterion
that thwarts attacks on trajectories. Evaluations with
real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm attains its
objective while retaining a substantial level of accuracy in
the data. Our work is a step forward in the direction of open,
privacy-preserving datasets of spatiotemporal trajectories.},
