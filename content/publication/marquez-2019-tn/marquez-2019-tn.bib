 abstract = {The economic sustainability of future mobile networks will
largely depend on the strong specialization of its offered
services. Network operators will need to provide added value to
their tenants, by moving from the traditional one-size-fits-all
strategy to a set of virtual end-to-end instances of a common
physical infrastructure, named network slices, which are
especially tailored to the requirements of each application.
Implementing network slicing has significant consequences in
terms of resource management: service customization entails
assigning to each slice fully dedicated resources, which may
also be dynamically reassigned and overbooked in order to
increase the cost-efficiency of the system. In this paper, we
adopt a data-driven approach to quantify the efficiency of
resource sharing in future sliced networks. Building on
metropolitan-scale real-world traffic measurements, we carry out
an extensive parametric analysis that highlights how diverse
performance guarantees, technological settings, and slice
configurations impact the resource utilization at different
levels of the infrastructure in presence of network slicing. Our
results provide insights on the achievable efficiency of network
slicing architectures, their dimensioning, and their interplay
with resource management algorithms at different locations and
reconfiguration timescales.},
