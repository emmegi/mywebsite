 abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) of mobile and wireless
communications networks aims at addressing a diverse set of
use cases, services, and applications with a particular focus
on enabling new business cases via network slicing. The
development of 5G has thus advanced quickly with research
projects and standardization efforts resulting in the 5G
baseline architecture. Nevertheless, for the realization of
native end-to-end (E2E) network slicing, further features and
optimizations shall still be introduced. In this paper, we
provide a gap analysis of current 5G system (5GS) with respect
to some specific enhancements and detail our insights on the
enabling innovations that can fill the identified gaps. We
will then discuss the essential building blocks and design
principles of an evolved 5G baseline architecture capitalizing
on the innovations that are being developed.},
