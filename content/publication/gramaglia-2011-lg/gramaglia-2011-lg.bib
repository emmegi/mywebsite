 abstract = {Vehicular networks allow vehicles to exchange information that
can be used to improve traffic efficiency and drivers' safety.
In addition to these new applications, Internet connectivity is
also expected to be available in the cars of the near future,
speeding up the global adoption of vehicular communication
systems. One of the requirements for connecting vehicles to the
Internet is their ability to autoconfigure Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses. In this paper, we propose an optimization to
Geographically Scoped stateless Address Configuration (GeoSAC),
which is an IP address autoconfiguration mechanism for
geographically aware location vehicles. The benefits of this
optimization are twofold: 1) It can reduce the IP address
configuration time, and 2) it can be used to reduce the
signaling overhead of GeoSAC. The optimization requires no
changes to the GeoSAC operation, being fully compatible with the
original solution. We derive an analytical model for the
probability of our optimization being effective in realistic
scenarios and for the IP address configuration time. We also
provide a thorough evaluation of the performance improvements of
the optimization, including simulations with a realistic model
for wireless technology, real vehicular traces, and experiments
with a real prototype, which provide strong support for our
analytical model.},
