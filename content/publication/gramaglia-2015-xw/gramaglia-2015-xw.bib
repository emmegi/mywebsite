 abstract = {Â© 2015 ACM. Preservation of user
privacy is paramount in the publication of datasets that
contain fine-grained information about individuals. The
problem is especially critical in the case of mobile traffic
datasets collected by cellular operators, as they feature high
subscriber trajectory uniqueness and they are resistant to
anonymization through spatiotemporal generalization. In this
work, we first unveil the reasons behind such undesirable
features of mobile traffic datasets, by leveraging an original
measure of the anonymizability of users' mobile fingerprints.
Building on such findings, we propose GLOVE, an algorithm that
grants k-anonymity of trajectories through specialized
generalization. We evaluate our methodology on two nationwide
mobile traffic datasets, and show that it achieves k-anonymity
while preserving a substantial level of accuracy in the data.},
