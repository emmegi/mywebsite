 abstract = {Summary This chapter reviews the trends in the end-to-end (E2E)
architectural design for 5th generation (5G) networks. It
describes the high-level ideas behind the common architectural
trends, with a first definition of their common capabilities and
how they can be leveraged to provide the enhanced key
performance indicators (KPIs) expected by 5G networks. The
chapter describes the common requirement and design principles
that drive the current efforts in both standardization and
research. It explains how the E2E architecture looks like, with
the description of the main modules and which fundamental
technical problems they will solve. The chapter explores the
open issues on E2E architecture and a possible migration path.
It introduces some of the novel enablers that will be a
fundamental part of future 5G networks and the associated
requirements. The chapter talks about how the current radio
access network (RAN) and core architectures can be migrated to
the future architectures.},
