 abstract = {Induction loop detectors have become the most utilized sensors in
traffic management systems. The gathered traffic data is used to
improve traffic efficiency (i.e., warning users about congested
areas or planning new infrastructures). Despite their usefulness,
their deployment and maintenance costs are expensive. Vehicular
networks are an emerging technology that can support novel
strategies for ubiquitous and more cost-effective traffic data
gathering. In this article, we propose and evaluate VIL (Virtual
Induction Loop), a simple and lightweight traffic monitoring
system based on cooperative vehicular communications. The
proposed solution has been experimentally evaluated through
simulation using real vehicular traces.},
