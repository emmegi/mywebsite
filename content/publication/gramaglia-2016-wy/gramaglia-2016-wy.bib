 abstract = {The performance of protocols and architectures for upcoming
vehicular networks is commonly investigated by means of computer
simulations, due to the excessive cost and complexity of
large-scale experiments. Dependable and reproducible simulations
are thus paramount to a proper evaluation of vehicular networking
solutions. Yet, we lack today a reference dataset of vehicular
mobility scenarios that are realistic, publicly available,
heterogeneous, and that can be used for networking simulations
straightaway. In this paper, we contribute to the endeavor of
developing such a reference dataset, and present original
synthetic traces that are generated from high-resolution
real-world traffic counts. They describe road traffic in
quasi-stationary state on three highways near Madrid, Spain, for
different time-spans of several working days. To assess the
potential impact of the traces on networking studies, we carry
out a comprehensive analysis of the vehicular network topology
they yield. Our results highlight the significant variability of
the vehicular connectivity over time and space, and its invariant
correlation with the vehicular density. We also underpin the
dramatic influence of the communication range on the network
fragmentation, availability, and stability, in all of the
scenarios we consider.},
