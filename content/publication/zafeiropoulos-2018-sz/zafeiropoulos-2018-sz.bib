 abstract = {5G network technologies are evolving in a tremendous pace,
enhancing the potential for being adopted and exploited by
vertical industries and serve advance networking requirements
needs. Towards this direction, a set of 5G PPP projects are
providing contributions for tackling aspects related to the
overall lifecycle of 5G vertical applications design,
development and deployment, including the activation and
management of the appropriate network services. In this paper,
a cartography of a set of novel solutions facilitating the
adoption of 5G technologies by vertical industries is
presented, aiming at identifying set of challenges and
relevant solutions as well as potential synergies among the
related projects.},
